# Mini_Search_Engine
A small-scale search engine for finding recipes in a JSON file, which is loaded into the environment. The engine can find recipes either by health, by prep time, or by simple string matching. This was originally part of a class project where we were tasked with writing a search engine, which was challenging because we hadn't been taught anything about regex or indexing before that point. The project turned out very well though, and I deliberately saved the recipes JSON file for personal use.  

## Additional goals: 

1. Add indexing to the engine. This will probaly require rewritting the search engine object, as well as a few other miscellaneous tweaks.
